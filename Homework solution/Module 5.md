# 1. If all the links in the Internet were to provide reliable delivery service, would the TCP reliable delivery service be redundant? Why or why not?

No, TCP reliable delivery would **not be redundant**.

According to the **end-to-end argument**, a function like reliable data transfer can only be completely and correctly implemented with the help of the application endpoints. Even if every individual link provides reliable delivery between adjacent nodes, data remains vulnerable to loss or corruption within **intermediate routers**.

Specific reasons why TCP remains necessary include:

- **Buffer Overflows:** Routers have finite buffer capacity; if packets arrive faster than they can be processed, they will be dropped despite the reliability of the incoming link.
- **Node Internal Errors:** Packets can be corrupted or lost due to malfunctions within a router's internal switching fabric or memory.
- **Process-to-Process Guarantee:** While link-layer reliability ensures data moves between hardware interfaces, TCP ensures reliable delivery between specific **application processes** running on different hosts.


# 2. Suppose two nodes start to transmit at the same time a packet of length L over a broadcast channel of rate R. Denote the propagation delay between the two nodes as dprob . Will there be a collision if dprob < L/R? Why or why not?


**Yes, there will be a collision.**

**Reasoning:** The time required to push a packet of length $L$ onto a channel of rate $R$ is the **transmission delay ($d_{trans}$)**, defined as **$L/R$**. The **propagation delay ($d_{prop}$)** is the time it takes for the first bit of that packet to travel between the two nodes.

If both nodes begin transmitting at the same time ($t=0$), the first bit from one node will reach the other node at **$t = d_{prop}$**. Because **$d_{prop} < L/R$**, the receiving node will still be in the middle of transmitting its own packet when the first bit from the other node arrives. Since two or more simultaneous transmissions on a broadcast channel result in interference, a **collision** occurs.


#  3. Consider network mentioned in Figure 6.19.png. The router has two ARP module, each with its own ARP table. Is it possible that the same MAC address appears in both tables? 
![[Pasted image 20260225222756.png]]

**No**, it is not possible.

ARP tables only store IP-to-MAC mappings for nodes located on the **same physically connected subnet**. In the provided network, the router connects two distinct subnets, and each host is physically attached to only one of them. Consequently, a host's MAC address will only appear in the ARP table of the specific router interface serving that host's LAN.


# 4. How big is the MAC address space? The IPv4 address space? The IPv6 address space?

The address spaces for MAC, IPv4, and IPv6 vary significantly in size based on the number of bits allocated for each identifier:

- **MAC Address Space:** Most Local Area Networks (LANs) use **48-bit** MAC addresses. This bit length provides a total address space of **$2^{48}$** (approximately 281 trillion) possible unique addresses. These addresses are represented in hexadecimal notation and are typically "burned in" to a Network Interface Card's (NIC) ROM.
- **IPv4 Address Space:** IPv4 uses a **32-bit** identifier for host and router interfaces. This results in an address space of **$2^{32}$** (approximately 4.3 billion) possible addresses. Because this space is relatively small for the modern Internet, the last chunks of IPv4 addresses were allocated by ICANN in 2011, and technologies like Network Address Translation (NAT) are used to help mitigate the exhaustion of this space.
- **IPv6 Address Space:** Designed to solve the exhaustion of IPv4, IPv6 uses a **128-bit** address space. This provides a massive total of **$2^{128}$** possible addresses, which is vastly larger than both the MAC and IPv4 spaces.

In comparison, the transition from the 32-bit IPv4 space to the 128-bit IPv6 space was prompted by the realization that 32 bits were insufficient for global connectivity needs.


# 5. How do Aloha and Slotted aloha work? Explain why slotted Aloha is more efficient than pure Aloha

**Pure Aloha** works by allowing a node to transmit a frame immediately whenever it has data to send, without any clock synchronization. Because nodes transmit at will, a frame sent at $t_0$ is vulnerable to collisions from any other transmissions occurring within a two-frame-length window ($t_0-1$ to $t_0+1$).

**Slotted Aloha** improves on this by dividing time into **equal-sized slots** and requiring all nodes to be synchronized so they only start transmitting at the **beginning of a slot**. If a collision occurs, the node detects it and retransmits the frame in subsequent slots with a probability $p$ until the transmission is successful.

**Slotted Aloha is more efficient than Pure Aloha** for the following reasons:

- **Reduced Vulnerable Period:** In Pure Aloha, the vulnerable period for a collision is **two frame times**, whereas in Slotted Aloha, it is reduced to **one slot**.
- **Higher Maximum Throughput:** Slotted Aloha reaches a maximum efficiency of approximately **37%** ($1/e$), while Pure Aloha only achieves about **18%** efficiency.
- **Wasted Capacity:** Pure Aloha suffers from more frequent collisions because there is no coordination regarding when a transmission begins.

# 6. Consider three LANs interconnected by two routers, as shown  (Figure 6.33).
![[Pasted image 20260225223419.png]]

```
a. Assign IP addresses to all of the interfaces. For Subnet 1 use addresses of the form 192.168.1.xxx; for Subnet 2 uses addresses of the form 192.168.2.xxx; and for Subnet 3 use addresses of the form 192.168.3.xxx.

b. Assign MAC addresses to all of the adapters.

c. Consider sending an IP datagram from Host E to Host B. Suppose all of the ARP tables are up to date. Enumerate all the steps, as done for the single-router (example in Section 6.4.1 in the book ) .

d. Repeat (c), now assuming that the ARP table in the sending host is empty (and the other tables are up to date).
```

Based on the provided sources and the network topology described in Figure 6.33, here is a comprehensive response to your query.

### **a. IP Address Assignments**

Each interface in the network must have a unique IP address within its respective subnet.

- **Subnet 1 (192.168.1.xxx):**
    - **Host A:** 192.168.1.1
    - **Host B:** 192.168.1.2
    - **Router 1 (Left Interface):** 192.168.1.254
- **Subnet 2 (192.168.2.xxx):**
    - **Router 1 (Right Interface):** 192.168.2.1
    - **Host C:** 192.168.2.2
    - **Host D:** 192.168.2.3
    - **Router 2 (Left Interface):** 192.168.2.4
- **Subnet 3 (192.168.3.xxx):**
    - **Router 2 (Right Interface):** 192.168.3.254
    - **Host E:** 192.168.3.1
    - **Host F:** 192.168.3.2

### **b. MAC Address Assignments**

MAC addresses are unique 48-bit identifiers burned into the network interface card (NIC) of each adapter. For simplicity, the following notation is used:

- **Host A:** `MAC-A`
- **Host B:** `MAC-B`
- **Router 1 (Subnet 1 Interface):** `MAC-R1-S1`
- **Router 1 (Subnet 2 Interface):** `MAC-R1-S2`
- **Host C:** `MAC-C`
- **Host D:** `MAC-D`
- **Router 2 (Subnet 2 Interface):** `MAC-R2-S2`
- **Router 2 (Subnet 3 Interface):** `MAC-R2-S3`
- **Host E:** `MAC-E`
- **Host F:** `MAC-F`

---

### **c. Sending a Datagram from Host E to Host B (ARP Tables Up to Date)**

When sending a datagram across multiple subnets, the IP addresses remain constant, but the link-layer MAC addresses change at each hop.

1. **Host E Preparation:** Host E determines that Host B (192.168.1.2) is on a different subnet. It creates an IP datagram with **Source IP 192.168.3.1** and **Destination IP 192.168.1.2**.
2. **Host E to Router 2:** Host E encapsulates the datagram into an Ethernet frame to send to its first-hop router (Router 2).
    - **Source MAC:** `MAC-E`
    - **Destination MAC:** `MAC-R2-S3`
3. **Router 2 Processing:** Router 2 receives the frame, removes the link-layer header, and passes the datagram to the network layer. It consults its forwarding table and determines the packet must be sent to **Router 1** via Subnet 2.
4. **Router 2 to Router 1:** Router 2 creates a new link-layer frame for the hop across Subnet 2.
    - **Source MAC:** `MAC-R2-S2`
    - **Destination MAC:** `MAC-R1-S2`
5. **Router 1 Processing:** Router 1 receives the frame, extracts the datagram, and determines that Host B is on its directly connected interface (Subnet 1).
6. **Router 1 to Host B:** Router 1 creates the final link-layer frame to deliver the packet to B.
    - **Source MAC:** `MAC-R1-S1`
    - **Destination MAC:** `MAC-B`
7. **Host B Delivery:** Host B receives the frame, extracts the datagram, and passes it up the protocol stack.

---

### **d. Sending a Datagram from Host E to Host B (Host E ARP Table Empty)**

If the sending host's ARP table is empty, it must first resolve the MAC address of its default gateway (Router 2) before it can send the initial frame.

1. **ARP Query:** Host E broadcasts an **ARP query message** on Subnet 3 asking, "Who has IP 192.168.3.254?". This message is sent to the broadcast MAC address `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF`.
2. **ARP Response:** Router 2 receives the broadcast, identifies its own IP, and sends an **ARP response** directly to Host E containing `MAC-R2-S3`.
3. **Table Update:** Host E receives the response and updates its ARP table with the mapping `<192.168.3.254; MAC-R2-S3>`.
4. **Packet Transmission:** Host E now has the necessary information and proceeds with **Step 2 through Step 7** as detailed in section (c).


# 7. Consider the single switch VLAN  (Figure 6.25) , and assume an external router is connected to switch port 1. Assign IP addresses to the EE and CS hosts and router interface. Trace the steps taken at both the network layer and the link layer to transfer an IP datagram from an EE host to a CS host (Hint: Reread the discussion of Figure 6.19 in the text).
![[Pasted image 20260225233128.png]]
In a single-switch VLAN configuration where an external router is used to interconnect subnets, the switch is partitioned into logical networks that require a network-layer device for communication,. Following the architecture in Figure 6.25 and the routing principles in Figure 6.19, the transfer of a datagram occurs through the following steps.

### **1. Address Assignment**

To facilitate routing between the two VLANs, we assign the following IP and MAC addresses:

- **EE Subnet (Ports 2–8):** `111.111.111.0/24`,.
    - **EE Host (Port 2):** IP `111.111.111.1`; MAC `EE-AA`,.
    - **Router Interface (for EE):** IP `111.111.111.110`; MAC `R-EE`.
- **CS Subnet (Ports 9–15):** `222.222.222.0/24`,.
    - **CS Host (Port 9):** IP `222.222.222.1`; MAC `CS-BB`,.
    - **Router Interface (for CS):** IP `222.222.222.220`; MAC `R-CS`.

---

### **2. Step-by-Step Trace**

#### **Step 1: EE Host (Sender) Preparation**

- **Network Layer:** The EE host creates an IP datagram with a source IP of `111.111.111.1` and a destination IP of `222.222.222.1`.
- **Link Layer:** Because the destination is on a different subnet, the EE host must send the frame to its **first-hop router**. The host uses the **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** to find the MAC address (`R-EE`) associated with the router's EE-side IP,. It then encapsulates the datagram into a frame with a **Source MAC of `EE-AA`** and a **Destination MAC of `R-EE`**.

#### **Step 2: Transfer from EE Host to Router via Switch**

- The switch receives the frame on port 2.
- Due to **VLAN traffic isolation**, the switch only considers ports assigned to the EE VLAN (ports 1–8).
- The switch identifies that the destination MAC (`R-EE`) is reachable via **Port 1** (the router's connection) and forwards the frame accordingly,.

#### **Step 3: Router Processing**

- **Link Layer:** The router receives the frame on its physical interface, checks the **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** for errors, and de-encapsulates it to extract the IP datagram,.
- **Network Layer:** The router examines the destination IP (`222.222.222.1`). It consults its **forwarding table** to determine that the destination belongs to the CS subnet reachable through its CS-side interface,.

#### **Step 4: Transfer from Router to CS Host via Switch**

- **Link Layer:** The router must now encapsulate the datagram in a new frame for the CS VLAN. It uses **ARP** to determine the MAC address of the CS Host (`CS-BB`),.
- The router creates a frame with a **Source MAC of `R-CS`** and a **Destination MAC of `CS-BB`**, then sends it back through **Port 1** into the switch,.

#### **Step 5: Switch and CS Host Delivery**

- The switch receives the frame on Port 1. Because it is associated with the CS VLAN, the switch limits forwarding to ports 9–15.
- The switch uses its **internal switch table** to identify that `CS-BB` is located on **Port 9** and forwards the frame there,.
- **Link Layer (CS Host):** The CS host receives the frame, verifies the destination MAC, extracts the IP datagram, and passes it up the protocol stack to the network layer.


# 8. In this problem, you will put together much of what you have learned about Internet protocols. Suppose you walk into a room, connect to Ethernet, and want to download a Web page. What are all the protocol steps that take place, starting from powering on your PC to getting the Web page? Assume there is nothing in our DNS or browser caches when you power on your PC. (Hint: The steps include the use of Ethernet, DHCP, ARP, DNS, TCP, and HTTP protocols.) Explicitly indicate in your steps how you obtain the IP and MAC addresses of a gateway router.

Downloading a web page from a newly powered-on PC involves a coordinated sequence of protocols across several layers of the Internet stack. The following trace outlines the steps required to move from initial network attachment to successfully receiving web content.

### **1. Obtaining a Local IP Address and Gateway Information (DHCP)**

Before the PC can communicate with the Internet, it needs an IP address. Since the caches are empty, the host uses the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**.

- **DHCP Discover:** The PC creates a DHCP discover message and encapsulates it in a UDP segment, which is then placed in an IP datagram with a broadcast destination IP ($255.255.255.255$) and a MAC-layer broadcast address ($FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF$).
- **DHCP Offer & Request:** A DHCP server (often built into the router) responds with a **DHCP Offer**, suggesting an IP address for the client. The client then sends a **DHCP Request** to confirm it wants that address.
- **DHCP ACK (Obtaining Gateway IP):** The server sends a **DHCP ACK**, which provides the client with its own IP address, the subnet mask, and—crucially—the **IP address of the first-hop (gateway) router** and the IP address of the local DNS server.

### **2. Mapping the Gateway IP to a Hardware Address (ARP)**

The PC now knows the gateway router’s IP address but requires its **MAC address** to send data frames across the Ethernet link.

- **ARP Query:** The host broadcasts an **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** query asking for the MAC address associated with the gateway's IP address.
- **ARP Response (Obtaining Gateway MAC):** The gateway router receives the broadcast and sends back an **ARP Response** containing its MAC address. The PC stores this in its **ARP table**.

### **3. Resolving the Web Server Hostname (DNS)**

To download a web page (e.g., `www.google.com`), the browser must find the destination's IP address.

- **DNS Query:** The host generates a **DNS query**. This message is encapsulated in a **UDP segment** and then an **IP datagram** destined for the DNS server's IP (learned earlier via DHCP).
- **Ethernet Transfer:** To send this to the DNS server, the PC encapsulates the IP datagram into an Ethernet frame with the **Gateway Router's MAC address** as the destination.
- **DNS Response:** After the query is processed (possibly through a hierarchy of root, TLD, and authoritative servers), the local DNS server returns a **DNS Response** containing the IP address of the web server.

### **4. Establishing a Transport Connection (TCP)**

With the web server's IP address known, the client must establish a connection to port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

- **TCP 3-Way Handshake:**
    1. **SYN:** The client sends a TCP segment with the SYN bit set to the web server.
    2. **SYNACK:** The server responds with a SYNACK segment, acknowledging the request and choosing its own initial sequence number.
    3. **ACK:** The client sends an ACK back to the server, completing the connection setup.

### **5. Requesting and Displaying the Web Page (HTTP)**

Finally, the application-layer exchange occurs to retrieve the data.

- **HTTP GET:** The browser sends an **HTTP GET request** containing the URL for the desired web page.
- **Encapsulation:** This message is encapsulated in a TCP segment, then an IP datagram, and finally an Ethernet frame destined for the gateway router (using the MAC address discovered via ARP).
- **HTTP Response:** The web server processes the request and sends back an **HTTP response** containing the requested HTML file or object.
- **Playout:** The browser receives the response, parses the HTML, and displays the web page for the user.
