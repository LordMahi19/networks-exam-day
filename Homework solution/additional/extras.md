In the picture we see two computers communicating with each other using network stack. Both computers are connected to some physical network and there are two networking devices between them.  Intermediate network devices have to examine data headers from relevant layers to perform their functionality. There can be other computers connected in the network, but they are not shown. While reading the reading task make sure that you understand the importance of this picture and can explain it.
