# 4. Network Layer

The network layer is responsible for moving packets, called **datagrams**, from a sending host to a receiving host. It has two key functions: the data plane (forwarding) and the control plane (routing).

### Control Plane
*(Note: The lecture slides focus primarily on the data plane. The control plane, which covers routing algorithms like OSPF and BGP, is a separate major topic.)*
