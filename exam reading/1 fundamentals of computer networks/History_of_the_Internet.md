# History of the Internet

The Internet has evolved significantly from its early days as a research project.

### 1961–1972: Early Packet-Switching Principles
- **1961:** Leonard Kleinrock's work on queueing theory demonstrates the effectiveness of packet-switching for "bursty" data traffic.
- **1967:** The concept for **ARPAnet**, the precursor to the modern Internet, is conceived by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
- **1969:** The first ARPAnet node becomes operational.
- **1972:**
    - ARPAnet is publicly demonstrated.
    - **NCP (Network Control Protocol)** is established as the first host-to-host protocol.
    - The first e-mail program is created by Ray Tomlinson.

### 1972–1980: Internetworking and New Networks
- **1974:** Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn publish their paper on a unified architecture for interconnecting networks, which would become the foundation for **TCP/IP**. Their core principles included:
    - Minimalism and autonomy of networks.
    - Best-effort service.
    - Stateless routing.
    - Decentralized control.
- **1976:** The **Ethernet** protocol is developed at Xerox PARC, becoming the standard for local area networks (LANs).

### 1980–1990: Proliferation and New Protocols
- **1983:**
    - **TCP/IP** is officially deployed as the new standard protocol for ARPAnet, replacing NCP. This is often considered the birth of the modern Internet.
    - The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is defined, providing a scalable way to map human-readable hostnames to IP addresses.
- **1982:** The **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** for e-mail is defined.
- **1988:** TCP congestion control is added to TCP to help manage and mitigate network congestion.

### 1990s & 2000s: Commercialization and the Web
- **Early 1990s:**
    - ARPAnet is decommissioned.
    - The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) lifts restrictions on the commercial use of its backbone network (NSFnet).
    - **The World Wide Web** is created by Tim Berners-Lee, who develops **HTML** and **HTTP**.
    - The **Mosaic** web browser is released, followed by **Netscape Navigator**, making the Web accessible to the general public and leading to explosive growth.
- **Late 1990s - 2000s:**
    - "Killer apps" like instant messaging and P2P file sharing emerge.
    - Network security becomes a major focus as the Internet's commercial and social importance grows.

### 2005–Present: The Modern Internet
- **Scale and Mobility:** Aggressive deployment of broadband home access (cable, DSL) and the rise of high-speed wireless access (4G/5G, WiFi). Smartphones and mobile devices become the primary way many users access the Internet.
- **Cloud Computing:** Major service providers like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft build their own massive global networks and data centers. Enterprises begin moving their services to the **"cloud"** (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure).
- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN):** A new approach to network architecture that separates the control plane (routing decisions) from the data plane (forwarding), allowing for more centralized and programmable control of the network.
